Willie was traumatized by dog booties for the first time today and made it blatantly evident that this was the first time a doggo had ever been subjected to such a punishment; an in-depth study on the psychological impacts of said punishment ensued.

While the following data have not yet been extensively analyzed, a trend is evident in the preliminary results below:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
x<-c(0,1,2,3,4)
y<-c(0,10,50,200,600)
df<-data.frame(x,y)
col<-sort(rnorm(5))
qplot(x,y,data=df,xlab="# booties on feets",ylab="# h*cks given",colour=col)+scale_colour_gradient(low="green", high="red")+geom_point(size = 3)+ggtitle("H*cks Given Based on Number of Booties on Willie's Feet")
```

This is truly a major breakthrough in understanding the emotions of doggos. For the sake of reproducibility, the author as chosen to include all R code used to create this graphic.
